<div><u>List of Pros of Gasoline Cars</u></div>
<br>
1. It still costs less.
<p>
    The price of petrol-powered vehicles is still cheaper than the newer kinds of cars. Why is that the case? For one, putting out a good EV takes a whole lot of research and development and a huge investment. The technology behind gas-powered cars, on the other hand, has been around for many, many years and has seen improvements over the course of time as well. In other words, EVs are just starting out but gas-powered cars have been in the market a long time and have improved since then.

</p>
<br>
<p>
    EVs may also cost more to maintain given the kind of components used to build them. For instance, when an electric motor or battery pack needs to be replaced, one would most likely need to go to a specialist while breakdowns with gas-powered vehicles can be fixed by someone with a good knowledge of cars.

</p>
<br>
<p>
    Above all, those with limited budgets would most likely choose a gas-powered vehicle given the friendlier price tag. And this even applies to used cars. Besides, given the newness of electric vehicles, there likely won’t be lots of used ones up for sale.

</p>
<br>
2. It covers wider distances.
<p>
    A 20-gallon gas tank on a car has about an average fuel economy of 20 miles per gallon. This means that a gas-powered vehicle can travel about 400 miles before it needs to be refueled. This is different from hybrid vehicles which depend on how much energy is consumed during travel. But to sum this up quickly: cars powered by gas will almost always be able to travel longer distances.

</p>
<br>
<p>
    An issue about the availability of charging stations has also been brought up. There aren’t that many these days compared to the number of gas stations one can find at various exits around the country.

</p>
<br>
3. It has greater raw power.
<p>
    Early models of EVs compromised on power to achieve better fuel efficiency. On the other hand, vehicles that rely on gas can become more powerful when they are customized for fuel efficiency. For instance, the displacement-on-demand system allows gas-powered vehicles to shut down some cylinders in order to save fuel under certain conditions. As a result, this gives drives more horsepower and efficiency.

1. It contributes to pollution.
<p>
    Given the concerns over global warming, some manufacturers are looking into redefining the way their car operates. In other words, they are looking into it as being more eco-friendly. This means that there are gas-powered vehicles that are marketed as environmentally friendly machines.

</p>
<br>
<p>
    But others argue that the best option is to truly switch to electric vehicles that don’t spout fumes that contribute to the already dire state of our planet. More and more people are becoming reliant on vehicles to get them from Point A to Point B and everywhere in between. The math is pretty simple: more vehicles always means more pollution. If we want to save our planet, switching to alternative ways to still be able to offer the convenience of travel but without the need to release toxic chemicals into the atmosphere is a good start.

</p>
<br>
2. It is a health hazard.
<p>
    Gasoline-powered vehicles aren’t just problems for the environment, they cause health problems for humans too. A person filling up the tank is exposed to gasoline, but worse things can happen: a gas leak in the engine or a general spill or accident. 

</p>
<br>
<p>
    According to the Department of Public Health, high levels of chemicals taken in from gasoline exposure like benzene may cause cancer. Although the long-term effects of occasional contact with gasoline isn’t widely known, the inhalation of fumes can lead to confusion, dizziness, headaches and breathing difficulties.

</p>
<br>
3. It relies on fossil fuels.
<p>
    The supply of fossil fuels on earth is dwindling. Since we can only get estimates, there is no exact proof of how much more is there to use. As such, people are calling for alternative methods to be used now rather than later. The argument is that we as a species should not wait until our resources are depleted to start acting. We should do what we can now.
