        Electric cars are growing in popularity every day. Just like conventional cars, there are certain benefits and drawbacks of using an electric car. Here are the top few to keep in mind:
    </p>
    <br>
    <div class="table">
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Pros of electric cars</th>
                    <th>Cons of electric cars</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tr>
               <td>Electric cars are energy efficient</td>
               <td>Electric cars can't travel as far</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Electric cars reduce emissions</td>
                <td>"Fueling" takes longer</td>
             </tr>
             <tr>
                <td>Electric cars require lower maintenance</td>
                <td>Electric cars are sometimes more expensive</td>
             </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <br>
<p>
    On the pros side, electric cars are energy efficient, are net good for the environment, and don't require as much maintenance as traditional gas-powered cars. On the cons side, you can't travel as far between refueling, the actual refueling process takes longer than filling a car at a gas pump, and upfront costs are sometimes a barrier.
    Below, we'll explore these pros and cons in further detail.
</p>
<br>
<h1><u>Advantages of electric cars</u></h1>
<br>

Pro 1: Electric cars are energy efficient
<br>


<div class="images"><img src="../Images/EV_energy_procons.jpg"></div>
<br>

<p>
    Energy efficiency refers to the amount of energy from the fuel source that is converted into actual energy for powering the wheels of a vehicle. AEVs are far more efficient than conventional gas-powered vehicles: AEV batteries convert 59 to 62 percent of energy into vehicle movement while gas powered vehicles only convert between 17 and 21 percent. This means that charging an AEV’s battery puts more towards actually powering the vehicle than filling up at a gas pump.
</p>
<br>
Pro 2: Electric cars reduce emissions
<br>
<p>
    <br>
    <div class="images"><img src="../Images/ele_emissions.jpg"></div>
    <br>
    Emission reduction, including reduced usage of fuel, is another pro for all-electric vehicles. Because they rely on a rechargeable battery, driving an electric car does not create any tailpipe emissions which are a major source of pollution in the United States. In addition, the rechargeable battery means much less money spent on fuel, which means all energy can be sourced domestically (and often through renewable resources such as solar panel systems).

</p>
<br>
<p>

    Improving battery technology in today's light-duty AEVs means they can drive 100 miles while consuming only 25 to 40 kilowatt-hours (kWh)  of electricity. Assuming that your electric car can travel three miles per kWh, the electric vehicle can travel about 43 miles for $1.00. By comparison, if we assume that gas costs $2.50 per gallon, an average gasoline vehicle with a fuel efficiency of 22 miles per gallon will only be able to travel 10 miles for the same price. The distance traveled for a fuel cost of $1.00 is nearly four times as far with an electric vehicle.
</p>
<br>
Pro 3: Electric cars are high performance and low maintenance
<br>
<p>
    All-electric vehicles are also high performance vehicles whose motors are not only quiet and smooth but require less maintenance than internal combustion engines. The driving experience can also be fun because AEV motors react quickly, making them responsive with good torque. AEVs are overall newer than their gas powered counterparts and are often more digitally connected with charging stations providing the option to control charging from an app.
</p>
<br>
<h1><u>Disadvantages of electric cars</u></h1>
<br>
Con 1: Electric cars can travel less distance
<p>
    <br>
    <div class="images"><img src="../Images/ele_distance.jpg"></div>
    <br>
    AEVs on average have a shorter range than gas-powered cars. Most models ranging between 60 and 120 miles per charge and some luxury models reaching ranges of 300 miles per charge. For comparison, gas powered vehicles will average around 300 miles on a full tank of gas, and more fuel efficient vehicles getting much higher driving ranges. This may be an issue when looking at AEVs if you frequently take long trips. Availability of charging stations can make AEVs less suitable for activities like road trips.
</p>
<br>
Con 2: Electric cars take longer to “refuel”
<br>
<p>
    <br>
    <div class="images"><img src="../Images/ele_con2_procons.jpg"></div>
    <br>
    Fueling an all-electric car can also be an issue. Fully recharging the battery pack with a Level 1 or Level 2 charger can take up to 8 hours, and even fast charging stations take 30 minutes to charge to 80 percent capacity. Electric car drivers have to plan more carefully, because running out of power can't be solved by a quick stop at the gas pump.
</p>
<br>
Con 3: Electric cars are more expensive, and battery packs may need to be replaced
<br>
<p>
    <br>
    <div class="images"><img src="../Images/ele_battery.jpg"></div>
    <br>
    The battery packs within an electric car are expensive and may need to be replaced more than once over the lifetime of the car. All-electric vehicles are also more expensive than gas-powered cars, and the upfront cost of all-electric vehicle can also be prohibitive. However, the fuel cost savings, tax credits, and state incentives can help to offset this cost overall if they are available.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Final Note</h2>
<br>
<p>
    Overall, all-electric vehicles, like any vehicle, must be assessed based on personal needs and vehicle usage. There are many pros to owning an electric vehicle, such as fuel savings and reduced emissions, but this can come at the cost of relying on battery charging and higher costs. Consider what works best for you when looking into purchasing an all-electric vehicle.
