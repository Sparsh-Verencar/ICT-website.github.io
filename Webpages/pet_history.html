            The early history of petroleum cars can be traced back to the late 19th century, when the internal combustion engine was first developed. Prior to this, vehicles were powered by steam engines, which required a constant source of water and fuel to operate. The internal combustion engine, on the other hand, could run on a variety of fuels, including petroleum, which made it a more practical and versatile option for powering vehicles.

            One of the first automobiles to be powered by an internal combustion engine was the Benz Patent Motorwagen, which was developed by Karl Benz in Germany in 1886. This vehicle was powered by a single-cylinder gasoline engine, and it was the first vehicle to be mass-produced for sale to the public.

            In the United States, the first gasoline-powered car was the Duryea Motor Wagon, which was built by Charles and Frank Duryea in 1893. This vehicle was designed to be used as a horseless carriage, and it was powered by a single-cylinder gasoline engine. The Duryea Motor Wagon was the first successful gasoline-powered car to be built in the United States, and it was the first to be sold to the public.

            As the internal combustion engine became more widely used, the demand for petroleum as a fuel source increased. This led to the development of the modern petroleum industry, which began with the drilling of the first commercial oil well in Pennsylvania in 1859.

            The early history of petroleum cars was marked by a number of significant innovations and developments. In 1908, Henry Ford introduced the Model T, which was the first car to be mass-produced using assembly line techniques. This made it possible to produce cars at a much lower cost, making them more affordable for the average consumer.

            In the 1920s and 1930s, the development of the electric starter made it possible for drivers to start their cars without having to crank the engine manually. This made it much easier to operate a car, and it contributed to the increasing popularity of automobiles.

            During the 1930s and 1940s, the use of petroleum cars was further enhanced by the development of the automatic transmission, which made it possible for drivers to shift gears without using a manual clutch. This made it easier to drive a car, and it contributed to the increasing popularity of automobiles.

            In the 1950s and 1960s, the development of the jet engine led to the production of the first jet-powered cars. These vehicles were designed to be faster and more powerful than traditional gasoline-powered cars, and they were used in a variety of racing and performance applications.
